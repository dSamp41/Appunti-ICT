# Meccanismi hardware per protezione memoria, codice, boot

<u>Prop</u>: scelta di implementare qualcosa ad hardware ha due ragioni
- efficienza/accelerazione
- forzare attaccante ad usare attacchi fisici che sono
	- più complessi
	- più facilmente rilevabili


<u>Def</u>: 
A component of a system is ==trusted== means that
 - the security of the system depends on it
 - failure of component can break the security policy
 - determined by its role in the system
 
A component is ==trustworthy== means that
 - the component deserves to be trusted
 - it is implemented correctly
 - determined by intrinsic properties of the component

- Trusted =/=> trustworthy


<u>Def</u>: ==Trusted Programming Modules== allow a system to:
- gather and attest (= misurare) system state
- store and generate cryptographic data
- prove platform identity (autenticare utenti, dispositivi, Zero Trust)

<u>Prop</u>: struttura TPM
- IO
- memoria non volatile: Endorsement Key (EK), Storage Root Key (SRK), owner authorization data and persistent flags; almeno 16 Platform Configuration Registers (PCR)
- Attestation Identity Keys (AIK)
- Program Code
- Random Number Generator
- SHA1 Engine
- RSA Key Generation
- RSA Engine
- Opt-In
- Execution Engine
- Increment register: usati per misurare il tempo

<u>Prop</u>: proprietà TPM
- TPM should be physically protected from tampering
- resist tampering but tamper evidence measures should enable detection of tampering
- TPM packaging must limit pin probing and EMR scanning

<u>Def</u>: Endorsement Key = encryption key permanently embedded in the TPM security hardware, generally at the time of manufacture.

- This key private portion is never released outside of the TPM. The key public portion helps to recognize a genuine TPM

> [!info]
>- TPM operations signing pieces of data use the endorsement key to allow other components to verify that the data can be trusted.
>
>- The private key signs data. The signature can be verified by using the paired public key to decrypt a piece of data. If the public key can decrypt, then it must have been encrypted by the corresponding private key

<u>Def</u>: Storage Key = used to protect TPM keys created by applications, so that these keys cannot be used without the TPM

- Unlike the endorsement key (which is generally created when the TPM is manufactured), the storage root key is created when you take ownership of the TPM.

# Software Guard Extensions (SGX)

<u>Def</u>: SGX = protects confidentiality and integrity in untrusted environments

<u>Def</u>: ==enclave== = isolated memory region for code & data
- enclave memory encrypted and integrity-protected by hardware
- enclave memory can be accessed only by enclave code

<u>Prop</u>: Each CPU with support for SGX contains two root keys that are stored inside e-fuses: 
- Root Provisioning Key (RPK): known to Intel to enable the remote attestation process
- Root Seal Key (RSK): only known to the platform for implementing the data seal


<u>Prop</u>: Protecting Enclave Memory
- All enclaves allocate their protected memory from a shared protected memory region called the Enclave Page Cache (EPC).
- The EPC is divided into 4Kb pages, which are allocated among the running enclaves
- The EPC’s page mappings are stored in the EPC Map (EPCM). Enclaves are isolated from the operating system as well as each other. Any attempt to read or write EPC memory by non-enclave threads returns an abort page value.
- To protect information stored in the EPC, Intel SGX utilizes a Memory Encryption Engine (MEE), which sits between the CPU and the Memory Controller
- When an EPC cache line is evicted from the cache to memory, the MEE encrypts and generates a MAC of the cache line and stores the encryption key and MAC
- When the cache line is retrieved during a cache miss, the MEE decrypts the cache line and verifies its integrity using the stored MAC before transferring the cache line back to the CPU.
- The MEE stores the encryption keys and MACs in a hash tree data structure for efficient access.


<u>Def</u>: Enclave Attestation
- Local attestation: prove enclave’s identity to another enclave on same CPU
- Remote attestation: prove enclave’s identity to remote party
