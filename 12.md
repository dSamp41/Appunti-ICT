<u>Def</u>:
- ==forward proxy== = protegge client da attacchi esterni
- ==reverse proxy== = protegge i server da attacchi esterni (fatti da client)
	=> può avere anche compiti di load balancer nel caso di più istanze del server disponibili

<u>Def</u>: ==stateful firewall== = it maintains a state table that tracks all sessions and inspects all packets passing through. If packets have the properties predicted by the state table, the firewall allows them to pass.

- ==Enable TCP stateful logging==: TCP stateful inspection events will be logged
- ==Limit the number of incoming connections from a single computer==: (can lessen the impact of a DOS)
- ==Limit the number of outgoing connections to a single computer==: (can reduce the impact of exfiltration)
- ==Limit the number of half-open connections from a single computer==: Protect from DoS attacks like SYN Flood. Although most servers have timeout settings for closing half-open connections, this can prevent half-open connections from becoming a significant problem. If the limit for SYN-SENT (remote) entries is reached, subsequent TCP packets from that specific computer will be dropped
- ==Enable ACK Storm protection when the number of already ACKed packets exceeds==: To log an event that an ACK Storm attack has occurred
	- Drop Connection when ACK Storm detected: Set this option to drop the connection if such an attack is detected.
- ==Enable UDP stateful inspection==:
	- The UDP stateful mechanism drops unsolicited incoming UDP packets. For every outgoing UDP packet, the rule will update its UDP "stateful" table and will then only allow a UDP response if it occurs within 60 seconds of the request.
	- If you wish to allow specific incoming UDP traffic, you will have to create a Force Allow rule. (if running a DNS server, create a Force Allow rule to allow incoming UDP packets to destination port 53)
- ==Enable UDP stateful logging==: Selecting this option will enable the logging of UDP stateful inspection events.
- ==Enable ICMP stateful inspection==: Select to enable stateful inspection of ICMP traffic. The ICMP (pseudo-)stateful mechanism drops incoming unsolicited ICMP packets. For every outgoing ICMP packet, the rule will create or update its ICMP "stateful" table and will then only allow a ICMP response if it occurs within 60 seconds of the request.

<u>Def</u>: ==Next Generation Firewall== = combines DPI with stateful inspection
(PI = controllo header / DPI = controllo payload)

<u>Def</u>: ==egress filtering== = filtraggio delle comunicazioni in uscita e non solo di quelle in ingresso
	=> fondamentale per rilevare intrusioni non ancora scoperte e che hanno connesso alcuni nodi protetti ad una botnet

- ==Deploy anti-spoofing filters==. DDPS attacks rely on packets with spoofing IP addresses. Anti- spoofing prevents flows with forged source addresses and the spread of malicious activity by users, infections, botnets, and malware.
- ==Only allow outbound packets sourced from IP addresses in your network==. It is also important to ensure that you are only permitting traffic sourced from your registered IP addresses.
- ==Filter internal-only services==. Reserve services that don't need to run across the Internet for internal networks to minimize vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or data leaking. The decision to block these services must be made with knowledge of your network’s requirements. If you need one of these services to run outbound to an external partner or vendor (cloud provider) you should filter the traffic to permit the service only to that partner's IP addresses
- ==Filter services that are often associated with malicious activity==. Consider blocking services outbound known to be used for malicious purposes. IRC is frequently used by compromised systems to speak to a command-and-control server
- ==Filter services restricted to a small number of known hosts==. Critical services run on a small number of known hosts. You can allow only these hosts to communicate over certain ports. This prevents data exfiltration or users running unauthorized servers. If you have an outbound proxy for web traffic, you filter so that only that proxy can communicate over normal ports. Specific services to consider limiting outbound from known source IP addresses include DNS, SMTP, HTTP/S


# Architettura di firewall

<u>Def</u>: ==screening router + bastion host==
- screening router = garantisce che:
	- pacchetti esterni siano rediretti verso firewall
	- solo bastion host può comunicare con esterno
- bastion host = nodo dedicato 
![[Schermata del 2024-03-07 15-09-03.png]]


<u>Def</u>: ==screened subnet architecture==
- exterior router: impedisce traffico verso esterno dei nodi
- interior router: accetto solo traffico da bastion host
=> aumenta ridondanza e robustezza

<u>Prop</u>: se interior == exterior; una vunerabilità può essere usata per attaccare entrambi
	=> usare router eterogenei

<u>Def</u>: ==defence in depth== (segmentazione)
- router
	- usato per connettere due reti; possibili connessioni uno a molti; funzioni di instradamento livello 3
	- router table + ACL su indirizzi IP
- switch
	- usato per avere connessioni veloci tra nodi di una stessa rete, connessioni punto punto livello 2
	- ACL mediante MAC address

<u>Def</u>: micro-segmentazione = deploy di firewall e app su VM/container

<u>Def</u>: Purdue Model = usato per sicurezza industriale
