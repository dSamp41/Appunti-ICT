# Comunicazioni private e non tracciabili

<u>Prop</u>: 3 soluzioni
- ==Onion Routing==: Single relays depend on a single operator that may be observed or coerced by an adversary to reveal the identities of communicating parties. The onion routing family of schemes alleviates this by relying on multiple relays that possibly carry communications
- ==Mix-networks==: In addition to multiple relays, restrict the size of messages to a uniform quantum and are engineered to allow for long delays and cover traffic to mask statistical leaks that could trace messages. Larger latency over onion routing and the lack of bi-directional communications restricts their appeal and drives the number of users down so that they may provide a lesser degree of anonymity despite their stronger designs
- ==Broadcast schemes==: Simply send all messages to everyone in a group without designing the recipient. Each receiver tries to decode the message with its keys, to de-termine if it is the receiver. These schemes become expensive as groups grow, since all members have to send or receive a message

<u>Prop</u>:
- <u>low-latency</u> anonymity systems (onion routing) are not resistant to an adversary that can observe traffic from the source and to the circuit’s destination and that in a short time, can de-anonymise the connection.
- <u>higher latency</u> anonymity systems suffer from long-term disclosure attacks where an adversary can discover the long-term communication partners of senders and receivers


# Moving target defense

<u>Def</u>: ==moving target defense== = integrazione di più tecniche per impedire ad avversario di raccogliere informazioni sul sistema o la persistenza
	=> modificare dinamicamente configurazione sw o del sistema

<u>Prop</u>: (tecniche)
- address space layout randomization: cambia indirizzo base dove viene caricato un programma in memoria
- instruction set randomization: encryption del codice in memoria in modo da impedire injection attack
	- istruffzioni vengono decodificate solo quando vengono eseguite o caricate in cache
	- variando la chiave di cifratura cambia il codice in modo imprevedibile
- compiler-based randomization: il compilatore genera varianti dello stesso codice per impedire di conoscere a priori quale versione viene eseguita
- diversificazione del software al momento dell’installazione
	- software installato tramite un installatore specializzato viene taggato ed associato ad una chiave random
	- al momento dell’esecuzione si verifica se la chiave associata è quella specificata dall’installer. Se è diversa l’esecuzione è vietata
- modificare i comandi mediante stringhe casuali e poi vengono eseguiti solo se matchano le stringhe casuali e non i comandi veri
- multiple OS rotation environment
- dynamic application rotation environment
	 - One virtual machine (VM) is selected at a given time to handle all network traffic, and it is known as the active VM.
	 - At a predefined interval, (15 to 30 seconds), the active VM is switched.
	 - When a VM becomes inactive, the integrity of the file system is checked for signs of attack and removed from rotation if any integrity compromise is detected. 

- Stream Splitting 
	- TCP stream splitting (SS) splits a network stream into multiple streams, making it difficult for an attacker to attack the system by eliminating the advantage of fixed system configurations and network architecture.
	- TCP splitting uses a performance enhancing proxy access node that divides the end-to-end TCP connection between the client and the server into a multi-overlay-hop path
	- Each overlay hop is an independent TCP connection, such that the RTT of each overlay hop is lower than the direct RTT between A and B.
	- Each hop's throughput is governed by that hop's RTT and is individually higher than the direct throughput between A and B
- Software Defined Networking


# YARA 
Ricercare Indicator of Compromise in files

<u>Def</u>: ==memory forensics== = process of capturing the running memory of a device and then analyzing the captured output for evidence of malicious software.

=> unlike hard-disk forensics where the file system of a device is cloned and every file on the disk can be recovered and analyzed, memory forensics focuses on the actual programs that were running on a device when the memory dump was captured.


<u>Def</u>: ==memory dump== = snapshot of memory that has been captured for memory analysis 
=> data relating to any running processes at the time of the capture.
