<u>Def</u>: identità
- Utenti
- Amministratori
- Macchine
	- identificatore è il nome DNS
	- identità indica il ruolo che ha quella macchina (testing, carichi utente … )
- Workload
	- richiesto da un utente
	- assegnato ad una macchina in un certo insieme
	- gestito da sistema di orchestrazione che offre Load balancing, Resource optimization

<u>Def</u>: ==TCB== = set of components (hardware, software, human, …)
- whose correct functioning is sufficient to ensure that the security policy is enforced
- whose failure could cause a breach of the security policy

<u>Prop</u>: definito un tipo di dato, conviene definire una funzione associata per il controllo e la
validazione del tipo stesso

controllo del codice decomposto in:
- Verifica della correttezza della funzione associata
- Verifica che ogni modulo che utilizza il tipo invochi la funzione associata


## Design for change

<u>Def</u>: progettare sistemi in modo da semplificare modifiche

<u>Prop</u>: cambiamenti devono essere
- Incrementali
- Documentati
- Testati
- Isolati
- Qualificati
- Staged = verifica i benefici di n-esimo cambiamento precedente prima di n+1-esimo

## Design for resilience

<u>Def</u>: design each system layer to be independently resilient 
	=> defense in depth with each layer

<u>Prop</u>: 
- ==compartmentalize== the system along clearly defined boundaries to promote the independence of the isolated functional parts
- use compartment ==redundancy== against localized failures. For global failures, have some compartments provide different reliability and security properties.
- reduce reaction time by ==automating== as many of your resilience measures as you can

<u>Prop</u>: (degradation)
select which properties to disable when dire circumstances arise, while doing all you can to protect the system’s security. If you deliberately design multiple response options for circumstances like these, the system can have controlled breakpoints, rather than a chaotic collapse.

<u>Prop</u>: (blast radius)
Controlling the blast radius = compartmentalizing the impact of an event, as compartments on a ship grant resilience against the whole ship sinking

- create compartmental barriers that constrain both attackers and accidental failures

<u>Prop</u>: (compartmentalization)
Isolate system elements and enable and control the interactions essential for their intended purpose

- building systems as elements that work in isolation; defining and controlling their interactions
- ensure that the architecture of systems facilitates security

<u>Prop</u>: (location separation)
- run the same services in different locations: Normal access control mechanisms can protect instances of the same service in different locations from each other, just as you protect different services from each other
- Location separation helps you resist an attack that moves from one location to another. Location-based cryptographic compartments let you limit access to applications and their stored data to specific locations, containing the blast radius of local attacks.
- Physical location is a natural compartmentalization border, since many adverse events are connected to physical locations
- Malicious attacks that require the physical presence of the attacker are also confined to locations the attacker can actually get to
